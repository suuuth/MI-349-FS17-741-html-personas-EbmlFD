				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<h3>To Liftoff!</h3><small><i>A Commercial Spacetravel Company</i></small>
				<p>Here at Liftoff! we aim to make commercial spacetravel affordable for the average citizen of the United States.  Scroll down to read more about our business!</p>

				<h1>Formal Pitch</h1>
				<h3>This is Liftoff!</h3>
				<p>At Liftoff! we aim to create commercial spacetravel that is aimed at everyday, blue-collar Americans.  We aim to do this by lobbying the government until they give us funding.  We figure that, if we bother the government enough, they will fund and subsidize our projects of blasting ourselves out of the country, and into the unknown.  For science!</p>

				<h1>Personas</h1>
				<h3>Three representations of our target demographic</h3>
				<p>Person 1 'Gary'</p>
				<blockquote>The first, and likely most common, type of person to visit this website will be referred to as Gary.  Gary is between the age of 30 and 50, and belongs to the Church of Scientology.  The Church of Scientology believes that "Man is basically good, that he is seeking to survive, (and) that his survival depends on himself and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe," as stated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_beliefs_and_practices#cite_note-5" target="_blank">Creed of the Church of Scientology</a>.  Gary believes that he will attain brotherhood with the universe through the use of the services provided by Liftoff!, and that is why he is visiting this website.</blockquote>
				<p>Person 2 'Al'</p>
				<blockquote>Named after Al Capone, this persona has some sort of criminal history.  Regardless of the details of that history, Al needs a new beginning, but he doesn't want to go somewhere that isn't as great as America.  He realizes that the last place left for him, is the Great Frontier of Space.  We will offer special discounts for these folks to travel extra-deep into space.</blockquote>
				<p>Person 3 'Smith'</p>
				<blockquote>The third, and least frequent demographic to visit this site will be referred to as Smith.  The Smiths are a very rare demographic, and difficult to study.  We haven't yet figured out why the Smiths want to leave their families behind to go explore space, but we are sure they have good intentions.  Whatever the case, they are our third largest demographic so it is important not to ignore the Smiths<blockquote>
