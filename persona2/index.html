				<h3>Jimmy Hoffa</h3>
				<p>Natural leader of the people.</p>
				<h3>Quote</h3>
				<p><i>"Move forward or get out of my way!"</i></p>
				<h3>Who is it?</h3>
				<p>James "Jimmy" Hoffa is rather popular in his area.  He has achieved local power by becoming the leader of local labor unions.  The people he leads, generally like Jimmy.  However, due to his position of power, some people have begun to see him as a threat.  Because of this, Jimmy now plans to seek shelter on the surface of Mars.  Thanks to the internet, he will still be able to do his work, and will also avoid being usurped.</p>

						<h3>What Goals?</h3>
						<p>To continue with his life, and his life's work, without fear of mob violence</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>What Attitude?</h3>
						<p>A very positive, can-do attitude. Jimmy believes that, with enough elbow grease, anything can be done.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h3>Which Behaviour?</h3>
				<p>Jimmy doesn't spend much time on anything, if he believes it won't help him lead or make money. He also has a rather short attention span. With these two qualities combined, Jimmy tends to not dig through websites to find what he is looking for. He would rather look at the front page, and move on if it doesn't look like what he believes he is looking for.  Jimmy wants to see a big, clear message of what the company is about as soon as his loads the page.</p>
