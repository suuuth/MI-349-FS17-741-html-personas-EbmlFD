				<h3>Christopher Columbus</h3>
				<p>Explorer</p>
				<h3>Quote</h3>
				<p><i>"For the execution of the voyage to Deep Space, I will not make use of intelligence, mathematics or maps"</i></p>
				<h3>Who is it?</h3>
				<p>Christopher 'Chris' Columbus is a local scholar, who is determined to contribute to humanity in some way. He has heard many people argue that the solar system we live in is flat, and that there is nothing else that may lie beyond the borders of our system.  Chris is determined to prove everyone wrong by travelling to these regions beyond our known borders.</p>

					<div>
						<h3>What Goals?</h3>
						<p>To achieve greatness through exploration and discovery</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>What Attitude?</h3>
						<p>A very positive, can-do attitude. Chris believes that not only will this journey be successful, but it will be very simple and easy to execute.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h3>Which Behaviour?</h3>
				<p>Christopher Columbus is not very well aquainted with modern websites, so he needs things to be very clearly laid out for him.  When he first visits the website, he will first read the introductory phrases in order to see if the website suits his needs and interests.  Once he verifies that the website is what he is looking for, he looks for contact information, and proceeds to contact the organization of the website any way he can.</p>
