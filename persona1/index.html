				<h3>Dr. Gary Goldstein</h3>
				<p>Successful Doctor, owns his own private practice firm.</p>
				<h3>Quote</h3>
				<p><i>"A penny saved is a penny earned!"</i></p>
				<h3>Who is it?</h3>
				<p>Dr. Gary has been a student for roughly half of his life, and is now successfully running his own office.  Gary is located in Florida, just a few miles up the road of the Kennedy Space Center.  Gary has noticed a sharp decline in the number of rocket launches he's seen in the past 9 years, and as a result, he now wants to help fund private space companies in order to fuel competition between Liftoff! and NASA.</p>

						<h3>What Goals?</h3>
						<p>To be involved in space exploration, without leaving the Earth</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>What Attitude?</h3>
						<p>Gary wants to be involved in space travel, but knows he doesn't have the knowledge to work effectively in the field.  But, as a successful Doctor, Gary has money, and wants to invest in the company.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h3>Which Behaviour?</h3>
				<p>Gary enjoys bringing guests to his house, and treating them to a nice dinner.  He enjoys showing off things that make him seem more sophisticated.  Gary doesn't like to be hassled by poorly designed websites, so when he does look for information online, he tends to go straight to the Contact page, and dials the first phone number he sees.</p>
